Medicine Store Management System customer verification support (Python, SQL, Tkinter GUI)

Abstract
========
Increasing health concerns among people demands efficiency in Medical Stores. The need to migrate from originally paper-based to electronic notebooks with data storage, computational features and reliable electronic documentation has aroused. For this project, I have designed a Medical Store Management System based on Python MySQL Database Access for small businesses. The software with an easy to use interface has been designed to allow stock maintenance, database access and electronic documentation for billing purposes with valued customer support. These features have been later used to compute discounts for customers, daily revenues, and determine steps to prevent potential revenue loss. Being an open source software it can be used by a wide variety of retail and wholesale outlets to automate the process of manually maintaining the records and cash flows. The results have been potentially generalisable. This software saves your time and money.

Motivation
==========
This is an Open Source Software designed for medical store management purposes for small businesses. In this era of growing demands of Pharmaceutical and Chemical products for health and medicine; every Medical store, be it a small of medium sized businesses are running rampant towards efficient store management and rapid revenue computation. Instead of using the conventional style of paper-based records and documentation, electronic methods are preferred for stock maintenance, automatic updation of records while billing and reliable electronic documentation. The software would reduce daily effort wage and labour numbers. Crushing numbers can now be left to the system. The system computes and displays the daily revenue total and also notifies the products to expire the oncoming week. The system is based on Python Programming language for scripting and SQL Database Access for storage of records. The advantages of these features are explained in the next section.

Technologies
============
In order to design maintenance software the basic requirements would be: a powerful Platform, reliable storage capability and a simple interface. All these have been accomplished by Python, a powerful cross-platform language that can run in any device with a Windows or GNU/Linux Interface. When coding an application, there is a requirement for dynamic content fulfilled by SQL. The mainly used technologies for the coding process of the software have been introduced below.


Python Programming
==================
Python is an interpreter, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.  Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding; make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse.  The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed. 

Tkinter GUI & PySQL Database access has been immensly used to design this software.

The software is designed to use this technology due to the above said reasons, to connect to the valued customers securely.

SQL
===
When coding an application, the decision to use SQL is a requirement for dynamic content. SQL is a database application that can be used by large or small businesses. SQL Queries can be used to retrieve large amounts of records from a database quickly and efficiently.  SQL databases use long-established standard, which is being adopted by ANSI & ISO. Non-SQL databases do not adhere to any clear standard. Using standard SQL it is easier to manage database systems without having to write substantial amount of code. With the emergence of Object Oriented DBMS, object storage capabilities are extended to relational databases.

We have used PySQL Database access for safe and secure storage of stock data.
SQL Database has a huge advantage over the temporary storage variables list, tuples and dictionaries in python which has been explained in the next section.
